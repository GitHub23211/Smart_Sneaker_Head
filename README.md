## Application Description
We wanted to create a Website that could allow users to organically buy and sell sneakers to each other. We want it to be an eCommerce website similar to eBay. It will have a searchable catalogue that users can use to browse items. Optionally, users can browse as a guest, but must register an account to add items to a cart. Users can list items if they register a seller account.

## Target Augience
There are no strict demographic criteria for our target audience but, in general we aim to cater our product to people who are: <br/>
* 18 years old and over
* Capable and knowledgeable of buying and selling products online.
* Interested in Vintage Sneakers
* Interested in Sneakers in general 

## Data Sources
User, Seller, Products, Cart, Wishlist, Product Review, Payment

## What our MVP achieved
We have a Landing Page with basic information such as About Us, FAQs, Contact Us and Social Media. We have a carousel to highlight feature products. A view for all the products on sale, filters for products by brand or by name in the navigation bar. A single product view that details the sneakers. We register and login users as either a buyer or a seller. A buyer can update their profile information, view their wishlist, view their orders and log out. Buyers can add sneakers in quantities to their cart or wishlist. Buyers can pay for their items with credit card using Stripe and apply discount codes. A seller can view the items the are selling, edit the items or delete their listed items.

## Project Source Code
The documentation folder has our markdown files for APIs <br/>
The public folder holds the assets of images and videos used on the website <br/>
The server folder holds all our backend code. inside the src folder are all our backend tests and backend files like middleware, controllers and routes. It also contains the pictures from the database used on the website. <br/>
The src folder holds all our front end code. We have seperated our components and styling files into seperate folders. Inside Components, we further seperated it into components for the website, the components for a user/buyer and the components for a seller. <br/>
Most of our work has been done on the highlighted folders mentioned above. <br/>

We created development branches for writing code to seperate functionalities and better workflow. For our documentation files, we used Google Drive to hold text documents, presentation files and video and photo files.
